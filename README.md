Charge distribution of a square plate

In Moodle I already provided a short source-code to implement an element function SavePlate() into our class SquarePlate, which we already defined during the lecture time.

Your task will be to implement this function. With the help of the provided exe-file MyPlate2018.exe (ShowPlate.zip) you are able to visualize the charge distribution on the plate. Your task will be to send the resulting output of your program within the given time limit.

To ensure that you not all can send the same file, I want the groups to use different subdivisions of the square plate:

Group    1 to 5                   5x5
Group    6 to 10                 7x7   --> (So, I did for 7mm*7mm plate)
Group    11 to 15               9x9
